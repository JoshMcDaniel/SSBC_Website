        <h2>Senior Pastor: John McDaniel</h2>
        <p>
            Hi my name is John McDaniel. It is a tremendous joy to be the senior pastor of Seminole Springs Baptist Church. Like a lot of people I didn’t grow up in church.  I didn’t have any desire for the things of God. But on July 27, 1997 I attended a revival service and felt a deep need to get right with God. On that night, I repented of my sins and trusted in Jesus Christ to save me.  Since then, God has dramatically changed my life. I now love God, His Word, and others. It is my desire to see everyone come to know Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior. I seek to preach and teach in such a way that the Bible would come alive to you so that you will better understand who God is and what the Bible has to say to you. God is doing great things here and we would love for you to be a part of it. Please take some time to look over our website and be sure to connect with us through the various social media platforms. I hope to see you this SONday!
